81602290791,"Only used twice but sits very nicely! Tried both 40 and 42, and both sat great. 40 was chopped too tight at the waist, i.e. it didn't look nice. I therefore chose 42. 
The first one I bought had small white ""dots"" on the hips on both sides, where one dot was holes. Therefore, I had to replace it. The first one had a much deeper nice blue color than the one I had to switch to,. But they claimed it was exactly the same. Just a little awkward!! But it's very flattering! Even with flare, which I never use! Is the right height and exercises a lot, but therefore also has a fairly large butt. This one was perfect for both that and long legs! NOTE!! It's a bit long, and you can barely wear good shoes with slightly thick soles, just so you are careful! :)",5

Also attracts extreme amounts of lint/dust etc.",2

The dress would be more impressive as a maxi dress and the top would be a little more close.

Only used once in sweaty rainy weather and I can't say for sure if the material is too plastic, it felt nice anyway as it is not a skin-tight model.

Not a full-price dress but light and with a nice pattern in the fabric, I dared to buy it at a discounted price even though I don't usually buy synthetic fibers.

However, cotton, linen, viscose and wool would win and a little fine-tuning of the details would help in the design.",3

30020677488,Cute knitted jumper that goes with both jeans or nicer trousers.,5
30016529804,"Became a size bigger than I intended to take when it was gone. M instead of S, but it was the perfect oversize that I wanted.",5
30013310374,"Nice and good jacket.
I read that it was large in size so bought an M instead of L. M fits well even with a thicker sweater underneath.",4
30016496739,Super comfy short-sleeved sweater and very cute (can also be used as a slipover). But the quality wasn't quite there. Fluff a lot. ,3
30007303236,I bought it as a gift and liked it very much,5
30013120080,Too thin in quality compared to what I wanted to use it as. But incredibly good and soft and nice fit. Long and good,3
30015900080,"Comfortable fabric and fit, but very small in size. Had to go up 2 sizes. ",3
30000832150,Good quality on this beautiful sweater. Nice colors which goes with a lot. ,5
30027118694,"I'm very happy and grateful for these pants. They fit very well, and are so comfortable. ",5

30017927291,"Good in size, but very uncomfortable as the collar goes backwards so you have to fix the cardigan all the time.",3
30017927291,"Good value for money. The material is wonderfully soft. The disadvantage is lint that comes off from the material to other clothes.

30016980822,"Likes! If you are closer to 180 cm tall, you will be happy to find a pair of pants/jeans with long legs. They are also stylish, have a perfect fit and are made of a good denim material. Not too thick, not too thin. Nice color to boot! ",5
30026609942,"Pilling a lot but is very nice and warm, perfect winter dress. What I fell for was the nice really forest green color, it's just like in the product picture. Something large in size, usually has size. 38, bought XS from this one, is just right.",4

30031570822,"Absolutely wonderful stretchy jeans, love the color and fit! I could probably have gone down a size since I'm between two and they are spacious. 

NB! A tip is to wash in a mild program (of course not with fabric softener + let air dry) before use, as they dry shed. My white sneakers turned blue ;)  Dark jeans in general require a lot of chemicals so yes they have a certain smell, after two washes quite ok in my opinion.

In size S, the dress is also a bit big, I think, but it is possible to adjust the straps, which is a plus, and this dress should be a little big/airy.
Recommend buying it in the size you usually wear. 

Love the color and think the design is nice, and it's comfortable to wear. Felt very nice and comfortable in this dress, and it works well as a summer dress and can be ""styled"" in different ways.
I don't really know what I think of the fabric - the dress wrinkled a bit after washing (w/ lift dry) and is almost a little more creaky now. Haven't tried to iron it!
I don't think I would buy the dress if the price wasn't reduced in terms of quality (textile, seams...). In any case, I am more satisfied than dissatisfied with the purchase (S) and the return (M).",3
